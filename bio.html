	Everyday I wake and spend eight to ten hours of my day tinkering with cars. What they did not tell me that was included was the all day spa I would be a part of. If this has flown over your head, the austin heat has the car garage over 100+ degrees all the time. Fans move hot air and the coolness I am feeling just the air hitting my sweat.
